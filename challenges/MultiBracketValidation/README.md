# Multi Bracket Validation

## Challenge:
Test a string to determine if it has a balanced set of brackets.

## Approach and Efficiency
Check the string for edge cases, if they pass then change the string to an array of characters. Iterate through the array and test for brackets. This is an 01 space operation (return a single bool value), and an ON time operation to iterate through the string array.
