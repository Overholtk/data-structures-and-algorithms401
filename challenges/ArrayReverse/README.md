# Reverse an Array

## Challenge:
Take in an array, then reverse it and return the reversed array.

## Approach and Efficiency
I used a while loop for this challenge because it requires fewer mathematical operations, and chose to alter the existing array in place instead of filling a new array to reduce the amount of space needed.
