# Code Challenge 2: Array Shift

## Summary:
Write a method that takes in an array and a value as parameters, then returns an array with the value inserted in the middle.

## Approach & Efficiency
I chose to use a for loop to insert data into the new array. To cut down on lines of code I added the param value into the array outside of the for loop.
